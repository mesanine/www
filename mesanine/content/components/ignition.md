# Ignition

Mesanine's configuration system is borrowed from a slightly modified version of CoreOS's [ignition](https://github.com/coreos/ignition). Ignition has wide support for all major cloud vendors and can be considered a predecessor of [CloudInit](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
